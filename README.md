# LSTM
Implementation of a character-level language model using Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks for generation of Text that resemble Shakespeare Writings. 


### LSTM Hyperparameter:

emb_size = 16
hidden_size = 256 
seq_length = 128  
learning_rate = 5e-2
max_updates = 10000
batch_size = 32


### Sampled test after 9780 iterations:

MARCIUS:
Besides for his sentence stand your hands.

CLRIOG HASAMIN:
What so fullow, cousin, if thou govern'd with
Ascocms tell me fair propes to this re.

KING RICHARD II:

And shall be your affactor. O, so directly, have straight
Abornour what they say, that a sister me
And hailing in your loather in Corioli man hath

It advarters all remembrance of coans fleyers
At Poal again o'erthall powers and sly:
This match upon the people, punster that say
that what for any trick on Henry's wood heart as else
Turns or grace gives me viritorier. Even black, Julys,
Thy dismong's son, and my haste aid my shone:

Even to come with mind. Poldar must have

And so say a pasted his head.
